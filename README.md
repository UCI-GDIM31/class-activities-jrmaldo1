Hello world!

### W2
The r, g, and b variables are floats rather than ints, bools, or strings as they are both number variables, and fractional numbers. It is the fact that the variables are fractional numbers instead of whole numbers that keeps them from being ints. In contrast, the __bounce variable is an int as the number of bounces are whole numbers. The error I recieved after Step 8 of Part 2 told me that my line of code was broken because I had not assigned a variable type for the brightness variable, which needed a float typing.

Table #4: If we were building a rhythmn game, and were writing a method named DidPlayerHitBeat that tells you whether or not the player accurately hit a beat based on the time that they pressed a key, we decided to have our parameters be floats. We additionally decided our return type or output would be a boolean. However, we did not come up with specific numbers for our floats. A metaphor to explain the relationship between classes and Components would be that classes are the instruction manual to components.
